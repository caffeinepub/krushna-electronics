# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the hero banner on the Home page so that background image text no longer interferes with the hero section's headline, subheadline, and CTA button.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the existing hero banner background image with a clean, text-free dark navy electronics-themed image
- Ensure the hero section's headline, subheadline, and CTA button remain clearly legible against the new background

**User-visible outcome:** The Home page hero banner displays clean, readable text without any competing text from the background image.
