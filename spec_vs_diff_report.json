  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx to add a strong dark navy overlay (rgba(5,10,30,0.75) = 75% opacity) plus a gradient overlay over the hero background image (hero-bg.dim_1920x700.png), directly addressing REQ-15. The file summary confirms the intent. No new background image is added (only the overlay approach is used), but the build request allowed either approach. All acceptance criteria appear to be met via the overlay approach.",
